# Overview: 

The AutoSDV project, namely the Autoware Software-Defined Vehicle, features an affordable autonomous driving platform with practical vehicle equipment for educational and research institutes. This project allows you to build a self-driving platform at home and use it in real outdoor road environments. Driven by Autoware, the leading open-source software project for autonomous driving, it gives you great flexibility and extensivity on the vehicle software.

AutoSDV provides a complete stack from hardware specifications to software implementation, offering an accessible entry point into real-world autonomous systems using industry-standard tools and practices.
